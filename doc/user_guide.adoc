== Utilities

=== Indexed Spliterators

http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Spliterator.html[Spliterator]s play an essential role in enabling parallel operations on streams.
They cover the elements of a source, which can be, for example, an array, a http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html[Collection], an I/O channel, or a generator function.

In order to allow parallel operations, a spliterator must be able to partition its source.
This operation is performed by the http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Spliterator.html#trySplit--[trySplit()] method.
If the spliterator can be partitioned, this method returns a new spliterator, which covers some portion of the elements, while the caller spliterator will no longer cover this portion.

Java's http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Spliterators.html[Spliterators] class provides static methods for creating instances of Spliterator from any http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html[Iterator].
The `trySplit` method of the spliterators produced by these methods works as follows:
it creates a new spliterator that covers a batch of elements obtained by repeatedly calling the iterator’s `next` method.
If the iterator’s next method is expensive, the spliterator will have a high splitting cost, which leads to poor parallel performance.
Such situations may arise if retrieving the next element involves extensive computations or long I/O operations.

In this case, if your source allows indexed-based access to its elements, you can use the _indexed spliterators_ offered by _Streamplify_ in order to ensure that your stream can be efficiently parallelized.
The `trySplit` method of the indexed spliterators is very efficient: it just divides the index range in two subranges of about the same size.

Two spliterators for indexed stream sources are currently available:
link:javadoc/org/beryx/streamplify/LongIndexedSpliterator.html[LongIndexedSpliterator]
and link:javadoc/org/beryx/streamplify/BigIntegerIndexedSpliterator.html[BigIntegerIndexedSpliterator].
The second one is needed for huge sources, with a number of elements that does not fit in a long.

TIP: Look at the source code of some classes that extend _LongIndexedSpliterator_:
link:{blob-root}/streamplify/src/main/java/org/beryx/streamplify/combination/LongCombinations.java[LongCombinations.java],
link:{blob-root}/streamplify/src/main/java/org/beryx/streamplify/permutation/LongPermutations.java[LongPermutations.java]
or link:{blob-root}/streamplify/src/main/java/org/beryx/streamplify/product/LongCartesianProduct.java[LongCartesianProduct.java].

Look at the source code of some classes that extend _BigIntegerIndexedSpliterator_:
link:{blob-root}/streamplify/src/main/java/org/beryx/streamplify/combination/BigIntegerCombinations.java[BigIntegerCombinations.java],
link:{blob-root}/streamplify/src/main/java/org/beryx/streamplify/permutation/BigIntegerPermutations.java[BigIntegerPermutations.java]
or link:{blob-root}/streamplify/src/main/java/org/beryx/streamplify/product/BigIntegerCartesianProduct.java[BigIntegerCartesianProduct.java].

Before using an indexed spliterator, you must set its _value supplier_, which, depending on the type of your spliterator, is an instance of either
link:javadoc/org/beryx/streamplify/Splittable.LongIndexed.html[Splittable.LongIndexed]
or link:javadoc/org/beryx/streamplify/Splittable.BigIntegerIndexed.html[Splittable.BigIntegerIndexed].

The `apply(long index)` method of a value supplier should return the element with the given index in the stream.
Using an index to retrieve the corresponding element of a stream is sometimes computationally expensive,
but in many cases a more efficient alternative exists: obtaining the requested element based on the value of the element that precedes it in the stream.
This is the case for most combinatorics classes provided by _Streamplify_.
Therefore, these classes use stateful value suppliers, which keep track of the last requested index and its associated element.
If the value of the preceding element is available, these value suppliers use it to obtain the requested element.
Otherwise, for example right after a call to `trySplit`, the more computationally expensive method of obtaining the requested element based on its index will be used.

When an indexed spliterator splits itself as a result to a `trySplit` call, the newly created indexed spliterator must also get a value supplier.
This is provided by the value supplier of the current spliterator, which calls its own
link:javadoc/org/beryx/streamplify/Splittable.html#split--[split] method.
If the value supplier is stateless, the return value of `split` may be the value supplier itself.
Otherwise, a new value supplier should be created.

TIP: Look at the source code of some value supplier classes:
link:{blob-root}/streamplify/src/main/java/org/beryx/streamplify/combination/CombinationSupplier.java[CombinationSupplier.java],
link:{blob-root}/streamplify/src/main/java/org/beryx/streamplify/permutation/PermutationSupplier.java[PermutationSupplier.java]
or link:{blob-root}/streamplify/src/main/java/org/beryx/streamplify/product/CartesianProductSupplier.java[CartesianProductSupplier.java].

=== Streamable

Objects implementing the link:javadoc/org/beryx/streamplify/Streamable.html[Streamable] interface
provide data in form of sequential or parallel http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html[Stream]s.

*Important methods:*

- `Stream<T> stream();` +
Returns a sequential stream.

- `Stream<T> parallelStream();` +
Returns a possibly parallel stream.

- `long count();` +
`BigInteger bigCount();` +
These methods return the number of elements in the data source as long or BigInteger.

- `<Z extends Streamable<T,?>> Z skip(long n);` +
`<Z extends Streamable<T,?>> Z skip(BigInteger n);` +
These methods configure the streamable to provide streams that skip the first _n_ elements in the data source.
The number of elements to be skipped can be provided as a long or as a BigInteger.

- `<Z extends Streamable<T,?>> Z shuffle();` +
`<Z extends Streamable<T,?>> Z shuffle(Random random);` +
These methods configure the streamable to provide streams that shuffle the elements in the data source.
If the _random_ argument is missing, a new http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Random.html[Random] instance will be created and used. +
+
Shuffling a potentially huge stream is not a trivial task.
_Streamplify_ takes a pragmatic approach and uses a shuffling algorithm that is fast, memory efficient and decently scatters the elements, although not in a uniformly distributed manner.
This means that `shuffle()` is adequate for most practical purposes, but not for hardcore scientific research.


=== StreamableProxy

Some streams can have a huge number of elements.
For example, the number of permutations of _n_ objects is _n!_, which means that even a permutation stream for 21 objects has a number of elements that no longer fits in a long.
For efficiency reasons, you may want to dynamically decide whether to provide a Streamable implementation based on _LongIndexedSpliterator_ or on _BigIntegerIndexedSpliterator_, depending on the number of elements in your stream.
This is possible by using a link:javadoc/org/beryx/streamplify/StreamableProxy.html[StreamableProxy], which forwards its method calls to a delegate.

A concrete class that extends _StreamableProxy_ must implement the following method: +
 `Streamable<T, ?> getDelegate();`


TIP: See the implementation of `getDelegate()` in
link:{blob-root}/streamplify/src/main/java/org/beryx/streamplify/combination/Combinations.java[Combinations.java],
link:{blob-root}/streamplify/src/main/java/org/beryx/streamplify/permutation/Permutations.java[Permutations.java]
or link:{blob-root}/streamplify/src/main/java/org/beryx/streamplify/product/CartesianProduct.java[CartesianProduct.java].


== Combinatorics

=== Combinations

To generate streams of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination[combinations] of _n_ elements taken _k_ at a time, _Streamplify_ offers the
link:javadoc/org/beryx/streamplify/combination/Combinations.html[Combinations] class,
which is a _StreamableProxy_ that delegates to either
link:javadoc/org/beryx/streamplify/combination/LongCombinations.html[LongCombinations]
or link:javadoc/org/beryx/streamplify/combination/BigIntegerCombinations.html[BigIntegerCombinations],
depending on the values of _n_ and _k_.

The code below uses the _Combinations_ class to solve the following problem: +
_Each morning, you must eat 3 different fruits.

        .map(combination -> Arrays.stream(combination)
                .mapToObj(i -> FRUITS[i])
